# Manhunt 2

```
Ah, now you know his name, good. Can you tell me the name of his last employer?

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format

This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may not be.

I typed the name "Johnny Dorfmeister" into a search engine and found their LinkedIn page \([here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnny-dorfmeister-1135a6179/?originalSubdomain=be)\). I initially tried the "Zelfstandige" company and it was wrong, I then tried "pishapasha" and it was correct!

Flag: brixelCTF{pishapasha}
