- downloaded "UltimateMinesweeper.7z"
- extracted it
- Assumed it was an unmanaged exectuable
  - had problems reading it in Immunity Debugger
- Later worked out it was a .NET assembly (by opening it up in notepad)
- Downloaded dnSpy
- Disassembled "UltimateMinesweeper.exe"
- Recreating the "MainForm" class in Python (nah disregard that)
