# Manhunt 1

```
My dad is pissed off! He was told by my mother NOT to buy ice cream but he did anyway when she wasn't looking.

Someone posted this picture on the internet and my mother saw it, man, he is in so much trouble!

I want to know WHO posted this picture, let's hunt this guy down!

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format, replace spaces with underscores ('_')

This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may not be.

I solved this with ``exiftool icecream.jpg``

Flag: __brixelCTF{Johnny_Dorfmeister}__
