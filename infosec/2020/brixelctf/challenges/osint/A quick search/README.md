# A quick search

```
Here's an easy one to start off the OSINT challenges.

I took this photo but forgot the name of this tower.

Can you give me the name?

I remember it started with an E.

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{fl-ag} format

```

The challenge offers up an Image.jpg file to download, and the solution to this is to do a reverse image search on some search engine, and hopefully the "Eben-Ezer Tower" will come up. I typed in "Eben-Ezer Tower" a couple of times and it came out wrong, so I just removed the "tower" bit and got the correct flag!
