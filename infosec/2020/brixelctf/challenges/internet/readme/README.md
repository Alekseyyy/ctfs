# readme

```
This flag is hidden in a readme

We will only guide those who want to learn on this one

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format

```

Okay this one was pretty easy. The solution is to read the guide \([here](https://ctf.brixel.space/guide)\) and you'll find the "brixelCTF{freepoints}" as the flag.
