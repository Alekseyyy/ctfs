# Keep walking

This is a challenge to test your basic programming skills.

Pseudo code:

Set X = 1

Set Y = 1

Set previous answer = 1

answer = X * Y + previous answer + 3

After that => X + 1 and Y + 1 ('answer' becomes 'previous answer') and repeat this till you have X = 525.

The final answer is the value of 'answer' when X = 525. Fill it in below.

Example:

5 = 1 * 1 + 1 + 3

12 = 2 * 2 + 5 + 3

24 = 3 * 3 + 12 + 3

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format

```

This is just a question of whether or not you can read pseudocode and implement it.

flag: ``brixelCTF{48373851}``
